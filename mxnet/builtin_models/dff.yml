description: >
  Deep Feature Flow significantly speeds up video recognition by applying the heavy-weight image recognition network (e.g., ResNet-101) on sparse key frames, and propagating the recognition outputs (feature maps) to the other frames by the light-weight flow network.t provides a simple, fast, accurate, and end-to-end framework for video recognition.
