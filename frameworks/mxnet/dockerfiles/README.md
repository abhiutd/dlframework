# Dockerfiles

ppc64le and amd64 dockerfiles with go-mxnet-predictor built in.

When running either docker image, you should be able to:

    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/songtiyani/examples/flower
    go build predict.go

If you want to try running predict, you'll need to modify the end of the dockerfiles appropriately.
